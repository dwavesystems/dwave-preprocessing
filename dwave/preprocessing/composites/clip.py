class ClipComposite(ComposedSampler):
    """Composite to clip variables of a problem.

    Clips the variables of a binary quadratic model (BQM) and modifies linear
    and quadratic terms accordingly.

    Args:
       sampler (:class:`dimod.Sampler`):
            A dimod sampler.

    Examples:
       This example uses :class:`.ClipComposite` to instantiate a
       composed sampler that submits a simple Ising problem to a sampler.
       The composed sampler clips linear and quadratic biases as
       indicated by options.
