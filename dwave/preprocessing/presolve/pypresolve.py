A class for presolve algorithms.

Presolve algorithms enhance performance and solution quality by performing preprocessing
to reduce a problemâ€™s redundant variables and constraints and to improve the
accuracy of the CQM.

The purpose of the following example is to show how to locally run the presolve
algorithms provided here prior to submitting your CQM to a solver, such as the
:class:`~dwave.system.samplers.LeapHybridCQMSampler`.

This example uses a simplified problem for illustrative purposes: a CQM with just
a single-variable objective and constraint. This is sufficient to
show how to run :class:`~dwave.preprocessing.presolve.Presolver` methods.

The CQM created below has a constraint requiring that integer variable ``j``
not exceed 5.

>>> import dimod
...
>>> j = dimod.Integer("j")
>>> cqm = dimod.ConstrainedQuadraticModel()
>>> cqm.set_objective(j)
>>> cqm.add_constraint(j <= 5, "Maximum j")
'Maximum j'

Clearly, the global optimum for this CQM occurs for the default value of the lower
bound of ``j``.

>>> cqm.lower_bound("j")
0.0

To run Ocean's presolve algorithms locally, instantiate a :class:`~dwave.preprocessing.presolve.Presolver`
on your CQM and apply a supported presolve (default is used here).

>>> from dwave.preprocessing.presolve import Presolver
...
>>> presolve = Presolver(cqm)
>>> presolve.apply()
True

You now have a preprocessed CQM you can submit to a CQM solver such as a Leap CQM solver.

>>> reduced_cqm = presolve.detach_model()
>>> print(reduced_cqm.constraints)
{}

The dimod :class:`~dimod.reference.samplers.ExactCQMSolver` test solver is
capable of solving this very simple CQM.

>>> sampleset = dimod.ExactCQMSolver().sample_cqm(reduced_cqm)
>>> print(sampleset.first)
Sample(sample={0: 0}, energy=0.0, num_occurrences=1, is_satisfied=array([], dtype=bool), is_feasible=True)

View the solution as assignments of the original CQM's variables:

>>> presolve.restore_samples(sampleset.first.sample)
(array([[0.]]), Variables(['j']))

You can also create the sample set for the original CQM:

>>> restored_sampleset = dimod.SampleSet.from_samples_cqm(presolve.restore_samples(sampleset.samples()), cqm)
>>> print(restored_sampleset)
    j energy num_oc. is_sat. is_fea.
0 0.0    0.0       1 arra...    True
1 1.0    1.0       1 arra...    True
2 2.0    2.0       1 arra...    True
3 3.0    3.0       1 arra...    True
4 4.0    4.0       1 arra...    True
5 5.0    5.0       1 arra...    True

class Presolver(cyPresolver):
    """Presolver for constrained quadratic models.

    The model held by this class to represent the instantiating constrained
    quadratic model (CQM) is index-labeled. This is because presolve may remove,
    add, change the type of, and substitute variables. Consequently, while the
    models remain mathematically equivalent, variables of the original and reduced
    CQMs may not have a direct relationship.

    Args:
        cqm: A :class:`dimod.ConstrainedQuadraticModel`.
        move: If ``True``, the original CQM is cleared and its contents are moved
            to the presolver. This is useful for large models where memory is a concern.

    Example:

        This example reduces an implicitly fixed constraint.

        >>> import dimod
        >>> from dwave.preprocessing import Presolver

        Create a simple CQM with one variable fixed by bounds.

        >>> cqm = dimod.ConstrainedQuadraticModel()
        >>> i = dimod.Integer('i', lower_bound=-5, upper_bound=5)
        >>> j = dimod.Integer('j', lower_bound=5, upper_bound=10)
        >>> cqm.set_objective(i + j)
        >>> c0 = cqm.add_constraint(j <= 5)  # implicitly fixes 'j'

        Run presolve with default settings.

        >>> presolver = Presolver(cqm)
        >>> presolver.apply()
        True

        The model is reduced.

        >>> reduced_cqm = presolver.detach_model()
        >>> reduced_cqm.num_variables()
        1
        >>> reduced_cqm.num_constraints()
