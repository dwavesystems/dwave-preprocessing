===================
dwave-preprocessing
===================

.. index-start-marker

`dwave-preprocessing` provides preprocessing tools for binary quadratic models
(BQM) and presolve algorithms for constrained quadratic models (CQM).

.. code-block:: python

    import dwave.preprocessing

This package contains several preprocessing composites that can aid in solving 
BQMs and a presolver that can reduce a problem's redundant variables and 
constraints to improve the accuracy of CQMs. For details on underlying 
algorithms and usage, see the package's
`Reference Documentation <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/stable/docs_preprocessing/reference/>`_.
