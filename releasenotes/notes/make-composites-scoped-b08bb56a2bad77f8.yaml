features:
  - |
    All ``dwave.preprocessing.composites.*`` are now scoped (implement
    ``dimod.Scoped`` behavior), i.e. they can be used as a context manager.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix inheritance in ``SpinReversalTransformComposite`` so that
    composite attributes override sampler attributes.

    See `#150 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-preprocessing/issues/150>`_.
