features:
  - |
    A newly instantiated ``Presolver`` will now have presolve techniques loaded by
    default.
  - |
    Add ``TechniqueFlags`` enum to represent different presolve techniques.
  - |
    Add C++ ``dwave::presolve::Presolver::add_techniques()``, ``dwave::presolve::Presolver::set_techniques()``,
    and ``dwave::presolve::Presolver::techniques()`` methods for manipulating the presolve techniques
    that will be used by the presolver.
deprecations:
  - Deprecate ``Presolver.load_default_techniques()``. Use ``Presolver.set_techniques(TechniqueFlags.Default)`` instead.
upgrade:
  - |
    A newly instantiated ``Presolver`` will now have presolve techniques loaded by
    default. Previously it would have no techniques loaded and the user would need to
    also call ``Presolver.load_default_presolvers()``.
  - Remove the C++ ``dwave::presolve::Presolver::load_default_presolvers()`` method.
